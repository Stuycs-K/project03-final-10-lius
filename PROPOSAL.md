# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Sophie Liu
       
# Intentions:

A music library player that allows songs to be played, added, removed, and randomized.
    
# Intended usage:

Users will be greeted by their complete library. 
They can choose to manually add their own songs, inputing song title and artist name, or automatically add songs via MP3 that are on their computer.
If there are songs in the library, users can input which ones they would like to remove.
Users can also choose to create a randomized playlist from the songs in their library and have it be saved to a text file.
Users also have the option to type in a song they would like to play. If the MP3 file of it exists, the requested song will play.  
If time permits, users will be able to create their own account, log into it, and store their unique song libraries to it. 
  
# Technical Details:

In this project, memory will be allocated to store songs in an array, randomized playlists and song library will be saved to a file, 
MP3 file information will be read to add the song with its corresponding title and artist to user's library, and MP3 files will be played with fork and exec.
Additionally, an array of linked lists will be used to store songs in the library. Sophie is responsible for all parts.
